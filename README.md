Web experiments for projected visuals

:warning: DISCLAIMER! This is meant to run locally in a computer connected to a projector in fullscreen mode, so... No. It is not responsive, it is not accessible and it is meant to work properly with the appropriate fonts installed in the system. It is a work in progress and it is not meant to be used in a production environment. It is a playground for me to experiment with visuals and code. If you want to use it, you are free to do so, but you are on your own. I am not responsible for any damage or loss of data that may occur. You have been warned.
